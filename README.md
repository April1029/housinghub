# Building a Platform to Make Housing Navigation Easier

Housing navigation is the process of helping people with limited incomes find places to live they can afford, possibly with the help of a housing voucher. Navigation also includes helping people with complex backgrounds find places that will accept them as tenants.

It is often difficult to find information about aspects of the landlordâ€™s tenant screening process. For example, does the landlord accept vouchers? Does the landlord have a minimum income requirement for all tenants? Does the landlord work with tenants who have imperfect credit or rental records? What is their policy regarding accepting tenants with criminal backgrounds? All of these factors can present significant, and often hidden, barriers to people trying to find housing.

Many agencies and organizations in Charlottesville perform the work of navigation. This process is slow, however, because of a lack of reliable information regarding the complete list of available rentals and the various screening processes used by landlords.

The goal of this project is to develop software for the internal use of credentialed housing navigators that provides navigators with an up-to-date and comprehensive list of the available rentals in the Charlottesville area, along with the various screening policies employed by landlords.
